<h3>RoC-Encryptor</h3>
is web application designed to provide an easy-to-use Rotational Cipher encryption and decryption tool. This application allows you to secure your messages and data with a classic encryption technique known as the Caesar Cipher. With RoC you can encode and decode messages quickly and securely.

    -         the offset, the shift distance chosen by an index heading left.
              Each letter is replaced by another letter of offset index located
              a little further in the alphabet.

2. decrypt()

-   takes two arguments:
    -         decoded password - analogically method decrypts previously coded password,
    -         the offset.
